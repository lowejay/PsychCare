<!-- OVERVIEW OF WORK
I have experience in both front-end and back-end web development, but I usually choose to work the latter because I enjoy server-side programming. 
I use PHP as programming language and phpMyAdmin/MySQL as server, I also prefer Sublime as my source code editor and GitHub for repository. 
I can understand these following Languages: English, Filipino and Cebuano. 
In terms of communication, speaking too much English makes me dumb, but in writing/typing in English, I am conversational.
As a fresh-grad, my biggest and hardest accomplishment that I had is creating a system for a company, without a team/collaboration, only me as the developer.
I'm a fast-learner, I would organize things properly and pay attention to details, also I'm highly interested to learn other web development platforms, acquire skills and to work with other people. -->
